# Unity Folder Setup
This Windows batch file will allow you to quickly setup Asset folders in Unity.

## How to use
1. Create a new Project in Unity
2. Copy the .bat file to your Assets folder
3. Right-click on the .bat file and select "Edit"
4. Change the value of the 'myName' variable to your name
5. Save and run

## Notes
- This batch file will create a personal Assets folder within your main Assets folder so that when working as a group, it is easier to know whose files are whose.
- I chose to have my personal Assets folder be name in the following way: "Alwin's Assets". Make sure to do a find and replace all on the batch file if you want to change this.
