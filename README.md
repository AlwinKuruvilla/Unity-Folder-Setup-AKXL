# Unity Folder Setup
This Windows batch file will allow you to quickly setup a personal Asset folder in your Unity project. This is helpful when working as a group since all files are separated by developer.

## How to use
1. Create a new Project in Unity.
2. Optional: If you created a project from an existing Unity template. Create a new folder in your Assets folder and copy everything into it.
3. Close the Project
4. Using Windows Explorer, copy the .bat file to your Assets folder.
5. Right-click on the .bat file and select "Edit".
6. At the top of the file, change the value of the 'myName' variable to your name.
7. Save and close the batch file. Run the file by double-clicking it.
8. Optional: Follow steps 5 through 7 for each person that will be working on the project.

## Notes
- This batch file was created following a common folder structure among the Unity Dev's I've seen. Feel free to modified it for your team's needs.
